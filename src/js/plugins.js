He's a selfish liar who only thinks about himself, he's more likely to be Tyler's father, not mine. He liked to play pool, it was the only thing he was good at doing, well, that and destroying people's lives.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\c[16]Relationship: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\c[0]\\\\\\\\v[40]\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"Sketch\\\":\\\"charinfo/Michael_[Original]\\\"}\",\"{\\\"Name\\\":\\\"Michelle Sullivan\\\",\\\"Category Symbol\\\":\\\"outros\\\",\\\"Description\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"This is my mom.
